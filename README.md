## Introduction
### This repo contains:
1. The initial version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm that calculates the best score alongside the best possible path written fully in Python.
2. An optimized / parallelized version of the NW algorithm. This technique improves upon the Row Based "RW" method by doing it for both Row and Column simultaneously to allow for parallelism whilst taking care of all dependencies.
